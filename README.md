# Project Management
Where we manage all the things for the Open Access Button. 

### To do 

- [ ] Translate labels, milestones, epics into what those actually mean.
- [ ] What teams we have & what they do
- [ ] FYI that we're using Zenhub
- [ ] How to's / rules / how to maintain guide: Everything needs labeling, processes once a week. 
- [ ] Open-ness. What we'll put up, and what we won't. We're Open by Default, but doens't mean everything is. 
- [ ] Repo description
- [ ] Link to backend for code etc. 
- [ ] Use of this vs todoist

### Coming soon to a repo near you

- [ ] Contributing.md (@?)
- [ ] Onboarding / team guide (@natalia)
