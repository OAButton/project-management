# Project Management

### Description

This repo is to track the progress of projects/initiatives/tasks for the Open Access Button. Code issues can be found here: https://github.com/OAButton/backend

We're using Zenhub, an agile project management tool for github repositories. Download it if you don't already have it.

### How to

#### Rules
* Issue care. A properly labeled issue has:
 * A label for the teams involved, who the work is for, and if it's maintance vs development
 * A Milestone
 * An epic
 * A clear description
 * An assignment
 * An estimation
* Maintain the repo by accurately labeling each new issue and placing it under an epic if applicable and including it in a milestone.

#### How to interpret this repository

* Assignments - the person / people responsible for the work
* Epics - The overarching goal/large task where issues fall under.
* Milestone - What we are planning to do/achieve within a time period (given month for this repo). 
* Labels - Description for what area the issue falls under. Issues should have multiple labels when applicable.   
 * Collaboration - Issues that involve collaborating wither others outside the Open Access Button project/team/funders.
 * Comms - Communications and advocacy related issues.
 * Development - Issues that are active, new development. This label includes code development as well as other active development in other areas (e.g. website copy, 
 * Epic - Overarching goal/large task where issues fall under. Place new issues under an epic if they apply.
 * Jisc - Issues that relate to the Jisc grant.
 * Maintenance - Issues related to ongoing maintenance (not active development). 
 * Ops - Project operations related issues.
 * Priority - Issues that are a high priority for the current or next milestone. 
 * Target - Our target for key metrics in that milestone.
 * Tech - Issues related to the technology team. 

#### Github vs Todoist

* Small things go on Todoist - e.g "Email Joe a file on Tuesday". These things will often have no use being seen externally. 
* Big things go on Github - e.g every issue. These things will often be useful to show openly.

### Our approach to Openness

We're working to make the day to day running of the project as open as possible, and make it easy for people to make contrbutions and critics of our work. However, we may obsure names or projects here if they're sensitive.
